|[Bolan et al. 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855312000013)|Adv Agronomy (ch1)|Even though DOM is small part of total SOM, contributes to several key aspects of C cycle including providing substrate to denitrifiers, enhancing mobility of pesticides, chelating metals, etc. <br> |

|[Thieme et al. 2019](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/16/1411/2019)|Biogeosciences|Coniferous forests = higher lignin-like DOC and higher DOC overall. <br> DOM was better segregated between forest types in stem throughfall and litter than subsoil (selective consumption of labile = all subsoils were recalcitrant?) <br> |
|[Cleveland et al. 2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-003-0236-7)|Ecosystems|Decomposition experiment with litter leachates of different spp <br> Hydrophilic non-humic substances more rapidly degraded than humic, hydrophobic substances <br> Overall more than 70% DOC degraded in ~first 20 days <br> no clear increase in $^{13}\delta$ C in this aqueous incubation (litter extract with diluted soil inoculum), the natural increase with soil depth must be mediated by sorption dynamics and later preferential substrate use?|
[Hagedorn et al. 2004](https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.00578.x)|Eur J Soil Sci|Extraction method (suction cup vs water-extraction of soil) influences chemical composition on DOM <br> DOM can be composed of remnants of decomposition of recalcitrant molecules, while labile are more fully readily decomposed. Incubation of labelled soil = mostly new C that was respired, and little new C contributed DOM...|
[Don & Kalbitz 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003807170500146X)|SBB|Release of DOC during litter decomposition happens mostly at different times during the mass loss process (e.g., needles lost more DOC after 20% mass loss). Coniferous = clear positive relationship between % mass loss and DOM humification index, not so clear for deciduous (beech and ash not clear, maple yes). <br> Slower but steadier release of DOC from coniferous is in line with higher DOC fluxes of coniferous forests ([Currie & Aber 1997](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/0012-9658%281997%29078%5B1844%3AMLAADP%5D2.0.CO%3B2)) |

[Stubbins et al. 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2017.00022/full)|Front Earth Sci|Stemflow DOC more enriched in coloured DOC as compared to throughfall. <br> Cluster analysis distinguished stemflow and throughfall C for Oak, but Cedar clustered separately (regardless of origin stemflow vs throughfall). <br> Cedars bearing moss epiphytes clustered separately! <br> |
[Le Mellec et al. 2010](https://www.afs-journal.org/articles/forest/full_html/2010/04/f09157/f09157.html?mb=0)|Ann For Sci|Looked at canopy throughfall DOM and POM (<500 $\mu\textrm{m}$) in two sites: Beech vs Norway spruce. <br> Spruce always higher TOC <br> More important throughfall during summer <br> Major CN flush was seen in 2005 in precipitation event following 1 month drought $\rightarrow$ **CN flows will happen through pulses** <br> insect outbreaks and frass apparently mediated large pulse in 2006 <br> Less temporally variable overall in spruce, but still detectable event of bark beetle... <br> more acidic solution in the dormant season...|

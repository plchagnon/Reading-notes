|[Astudillo-Garcia et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-019-09963-0)|Appl Microbiol Biotech|Review methods to link microbiome to ecosystem health. First step is to find correlation between degradation/anthropogenic factors and taxa of interest (which can serve as bioindicators). Their table 1 cite many examples. Threshold analytical tools such as [TITAN](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2009.00007.x) can be useful. Indicator species analysis and [LefSE](https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-6-r60) can also be useful for groups. More recent [Zicoseq](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35986393/) also, in 2022!|

Bacterial communities can serve as indicators of current, and **past** environmental conditions! Challenge is now to develop training database so that future studies can directly proceed with classification/prediction!|

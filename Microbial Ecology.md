[Degens et al. 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00018-9)|SBB|Decrease in catabolic diversity/evenness seen as reduction in microbial community's tolerance to stress/disturbance. Cropped soil (lower catabolic diversity) was compared to pasture soil (higher $H'$): various stresses (salinity, metals, low pH) more drastically impacted respiratory responses in cropped soils|
